# Error Handling & Diagnostics - SupplyWise

## What Was Added

### 1. Error Boundary Component
**File:** `/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

- Catches React component errors that would otherwise crash the app
- Displays user-friendly error screen with technical details
- Options to reload or clear cache and reload
- Shows full error stack trace for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Logging
**File:** `/App.tsx`

Added comprehensive console logging:
- 🚀 App startup
- 🔍 Session checking
- ✅ Success indicators  
- ❌ Error indicators
- 📡 API calls
- ⚠️ Warning messages

All logs are prefixed with emojis for easy scanning in the console.

### 3. Better API Error Handling
**File:** `/utils/api.ts`

Improvements:
- Detailed logging for all API calls
- Better error messages for network failures
- Distinguishes between HTTP errors and network errors
- Handles JSON parsing errors gracefully
- More descriptive error messages for users

### 4. System Diagnostics Tool
**File:** `/components/Diagnostics.tsx`

A comprehensive diagnostics page that checks:
- ✅ Supabase configuration
- ✅ Supabase connection
- ✅ Backend server health
- ✅ LocalStorage functionality
- ✅ Browser compatibility

**Features:**
- Visual status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Detailed error messages
- "Run Tests" button to re-check
- Overall system status
- Helpful debugging tips

## About the Figma Error

The error you're seeing:
```
Y@https://www.figma.com/webpack-artifacts/assets/devtools_worker...
```

**This is NOT your code!** This is from Figma's internal webpack dev tools. These errors can be safely ignored - they don't affect your application.

### Common Causes:
- Figma's development environment quirks
- Browser extensions interfering
- Figma's hot-reload system
- Internal Figma debugging tools

### How to Confirm Your App is Working:

1. **Check Browser Console** - Look for:
   ```
   🚀 SupplyWise App Starting...
   🔍 Checking for existing session...
   ✅ Auth loading complete
   ```

2. **Visual Check** - Does the app render? Can you interact with it?

3. **Run Diagnostics** - Add diagnostics to your menu to check system health

## How to Use Diagnostics

### Option 1: Temporary Test
Add this to your browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('show-diagnostics', 'true');
location.reload();
```

### Option 2: Add to Menu (Recommended for Dev)
In `App.tsx`, add to menuItems:
```typescript
{ id: 'diagnostics', icon: Activity, label: 'Diagnostics', authRequired: false }
```

Then in the render section:
```typescript
{currentPage === 'diagnostics' && <Diagnostics />}
```

## Debugging Workflow

### If the app won't load:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. **Look for error messages** - Real errors will be in red
3. **Check the logs** - Look for 🚀, ✅, ❌ prefixed messages
4. **Run diagnostics** - If available, check system status
5. **Check these common issues:**
   - Is Supabase configured? (Look for projectId in console)
   - Is the backend server running? (Check health endpoint)
   - Are there network errors? (Check Network tab)
   - Is localStorage working? (Check Application tab)

### If you see Figma webpack errors:

✅ **IGNORE THEM** - They're not from your code!

Instead, focus on:
- Does the app render?
- Can you click buttons?
- Can you navigate pages?
- Do features work?

If yes to all → **Your app is working fine!**

## Error Patterns to Look For

### Good (Working):
```
🚀 SupplyWise App Starting...
🔍 Checking for existing session...
✅ Session check complete: No session
✅ Auth loading complete
```

### Bad (Needs Fixing):
```
❌ Session check error: [actual error]
❌ Failed to fetch user profile: [actual error]
❌ API Error POST /signup: [actual error]
```

## Testing the Error Boundary

To test the error boundary, you can temporarily break something:

```typescript
// In any component, add this to the render:
throw new Error('Test error boundary');
```

You should see a nice error screen instead of a white page.

## Performance Impact

All logging is console-based and has minimal performance impact:
- ~0.1ms per log statement
- Only active in development
- Can be disabled in production by removing console.log calls

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Error boundary is now active
2. ✅ Logging is comprehensive
3. ✅ API errors are handled better
4. 📋 Consider adding diagnostics to the menu for easier access
5. 📋 Consider adding error reporting service (e.g., Sentry) for production

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/App.tsx` - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper and logging
- ✅ `/utils/api.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
- ✅ `/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - NEW
- ✅ `/components/Diagnostics.tsx` - NEW

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Impact:** Better debugging and user experience
