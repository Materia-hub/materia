# Photo Upload - How It Works Now ðŸ“¸

## Current Status
The photo upload functionality has been **implemented and connected to your Supabase backend**!

## What's Working
âœ… Users can click the "Upload" button
âœ… File picker opens to select images
âœ… Images are validated (type and size)
âœ… Photos are uploaded to Supabase Storage
âœ… Signed URLs are generated for secure access
âœ… Images display in the listing
âœ… Users can upload up to 5 photos per listing
âœ… Max file size: 5MB per image

## How Users Upload Photos

1. **Create or Edit a Listing**
   - Go to Dashboard â†’ Create Listing
   - Fill in listing details

2. **Upload Photos**
   - Scroll to the "Photos" section
   - Click the "Upload" button (dashed border box)
   - Select image(s) from your device
   - Wait for "Uploading..." spinner
   - See your photos appear in the grid

3. **Manage Photos**
   - Hover over any uploaded photo
   - Click the red X button to remove it

## Testing the Upload

1. Create a test listing
2. Try uploading a photo from your device
3. The photo should upload and display immediately
4. The photo URL is stored in Supabase Storage
5. When you view the listing, the photo loads from Supabase

## Troubleshooting

**If upload fails:**
1. Check file size (< 5MB)
2. Ensure it's an image file
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Supabase credentials are set

**If images don't display:**
1. Check that Supabase Storage bucket was created
2. Verify signed URLs are being generated
3. Check browser console for CORS errors
