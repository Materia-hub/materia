## 🔍 What to Test Next

### User Flows to Test
- [ ] Sign up → Create listing → Edit listing → Delete listing
- [ ] Browse listings → Filter by category → View details
- [ ] Upload multiple photos to a listing
- [ ] Create listings with "Make an Offer" vs "Buy It Now"
- [ ] Set bulk pricing tiers
- [ ] Test on mobile device (responsive design)
- [ ] Test as different user types (buyer, seller, admin)

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Upload image over 5MB (should show error)
- [ ] Create listing without required fields
- [ ] Search with no results
- [ ] Delete a listing that doesn't exist
- [ ] Upload 6 photos (should limit to 5)

---

## 📊 Current Limitations (Expected for Testing Phase)

### Working with Mock Data
- **Messages**: UI is ready, but messages are mock data (not saved to DB yet)
- **Transactions**: UI is ready, but transactions are mock data
- **User Authentication**: Using localStorage (not Supabase Auth yet)
- **Pickup Scheduling**: UI is ready, but not connected to backend

### These are UI-only for now:
✅ Great for demos and user testing
✅ Show investors what features will look like
❌ Won't persist between browser sessions

### Want to make these real?
Just ask! We can connect them to the backend anytime.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Photos won't upload"
- Check file size (< 5MB)
- Check file format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Try a different browser

### "Listings disappear after refresh"
- This should NOT happen (they're in the database)
- If it does, check browser console for API errors
- Verify Supabase credentials are configured

### "Can't create a listing"
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Open browser console for error messages
- Try refreshing the page and trying again

### "Search doesn't work"
- This is working with real backend filtering
- If no results, your search term might not match
- Try broader search terms
