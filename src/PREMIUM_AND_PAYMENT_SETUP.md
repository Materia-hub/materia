### Production Mode (When Ready)

#### Step 1: Get Stripe Account
1. Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Go to Developers → API Keys
3. Copy your Secret Key (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variable
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here

# Or add via Supabase Dashboard:
# Project → Edge Functions → Secrets
# Name: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
# Value: sk_test_...
```

#### Step 3: Test
Use Stripe test card:
- Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiry: `12/25`
- CVV: `123`
- Zip: `12345`

#### Step 4: Deploy

### Payment Not Working
- **Test mode**: Payments are simulated, no real processing
- **Stripe mode**: Check `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set
