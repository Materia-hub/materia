# SupplyWise Deployment Guide ðŸš€

## Current Status
Your SupplyWise app is currently running in the **Figma Make environment** with:
- âœ… Frontend: React/Next.js application
- âœ… Backend: Supabase Edge Functions (Hono server)
- âœ… Database: Supabase KV Store
- âœ… Storage: Supabase Storage (for images)
- âœ… All features working locally

## Option 1: Keep Using Figma Make (Recommended for Testing)

Your app is already live and accessible through Figma Make! This is perfect for:
- Testing and prototyping
- Showing to stakeholders
- Iterating on features
- Getting user feedback

**No additional setup needed** - your app is already deployed!

## Option 2: Deploy to Production (For Going Live)

To launch SupplyWise as a real website, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Project

2. Create a new project
3. Note down these credentials:
   - Project URL

   - Service Role Key (keep this secret!)

### Step 2: Export Your Code from Figma Make
1. In Figma Make, export all your files
2. Download the complete project as a zip file
3. Extract to a local folder

### Step 3: Deploy Backend to Supabase
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Deploy the edge function
supabase functions deploy make-server-8ae6fee0 --no-verify-jwt
```

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend

#### Option B: Netlify (Also Free)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your build folder
3. Add environment variables
