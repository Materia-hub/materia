# 🐛 Debug Mode Quick Guide

## Current Status: ⚠️ DEBUG MODE IS **ON**

Debug tools are currently **visible to all users** who access your app.

---

## 🚀 To Deploy to Production

**Open this file:** `/utils/config.ts`

**Change line 6 from:**
```typescript
export const DEBUG_MODE = true;
```

**To:**
```typescript
export const DEBUG_MODE = false;
```

**Save the file. Done!** 🎉

---

## What Changes When You Turn Debug Mode Off?

### ✅ What Disappears:
- Yellow warning banner at the top
- "Backend: Up-to-date" status indicator in header
- Deployment instructions on Dashboard
- Backend connectivity checker on Dashboard
- Listing debugger panel on Dashboard

### ✅ What Stays the Same:
- All app functionality works normally
- Users can still browse, create listings, message, etc.
- Backend logging continues (for your troubleshooting)
- No features are broken

---

## Before You Deploy

1. ✅ Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` in `/utils/config.ts`
2. ✅ Deploy backend: `supabase functions deploy server`
3. ✅ Test the app yourself
4. ✅ Make sure no debug panels show up

---

## Need Help Debugging Later?

Just set `DEBUG_MODE = true` again in `/utils/config.ts` and all your debug tools come back instantly!

---

## File Locations

- **Config file:** `/utils/config.ts` (⭐ This is what you change)
- **Full guide:** `/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Components that check debug mode:**
  - `/App.tsx` (header status indicator)
  - `/components/Dashboard.tsx` (debug panels)
  - `/components/DebugModeBanner.tsx` (yellow warning)

---

**Remember:** Debug mode only affects what's **displayed** to users. It doesn't change how the app works!
