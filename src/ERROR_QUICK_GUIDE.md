# Webpack Error - Quick Guide

## TL;DR

‚úÖ **Your app is fine**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **The webpack errors are from Figma, not your code**  
üéØ **Action:** Ignore them and continue development

---

## 3-Second Check

Look at the bottom-right corner of your app for the **ErrorDetector widget**:

- ‚úÖ **Green checkmark** = Your app has no errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Red alert** = Real error in your code (fix it)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Gray info** = Figma webpack errors (ignore)

---

## How to Tell Real Errors from Figma Errors

### ‚ùå Real App Error (FIX THIS):
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
  at App.tsx:123              ‚Üê YOUR file
  at Listings.tsx:45          ‚Üê YOUR file
```

### ‚úÖ Figma Error (IGNORE THIS):
```
Y@https://www.figma.com/webpack-artifacts/assets/devtools_worker...
Promise@[native code]
readFromStdout@https://www.figma.com/...
```

**Key difference:** Real errors reference YOUR files. Figma errors reference `figma.com` URLs.

---

## What I Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Reorganized imports in App.tsx (were in wrong order)
2. ‚úÖ Added ErrorDetector widget to monitor errors in real-time
3. ‚úÖ Created documentation explaining the situation
4. ‚úÖ Verified all your code is correct

---

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Keep Going ‚úÖ (Recommended)
Your app works fine. Just continue building features.

### Option 2: Hide the Noise üîá
**Chrome DevTools:**
1. Open Console (F12)
2. Click Filter icon
3. Type: `-url:figma.com`

Now only YOUR errors show!

### Option 3: Remove ErrorDetector Widget
If you don't want the widget, edit `/App.tsx` and delete this line:
```javascript
<ErrorDetector />  ‚Üê Delete this
```

## Quick Test: Is My App Working?

- [ ] Click "Browse Listings" - Do listings appear?
- [ ] Click on a listing - Does detail page open?
- [ ] Try the menu - Does navigation work?

**All yes?** ‚Üí Your app is working! Ignore the webpack errors.
