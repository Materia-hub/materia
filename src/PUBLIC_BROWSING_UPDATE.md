## 🎯 What Changed

### App.tsx Changes

#### 1. **Public Browsing**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Required login to view anything
if (!currentUser) {
  return <Onboarding />;
}

// AFTER: Allow public browsing
if (isOnboarding) {
  return <Onboarding />;
}
// currentUser can be null - that's OK!
```

#### 2. **Navigation Updates**
- Browse Listings is always visible
- Sign In button for non-logged-in users
- Protected features (Dashboard, Messages, etc.) only show when logged in
- Default view is "listings" for public, "dashboard" for logged-in users

#### 3. **Listing Refresh**
```typescript
// Added automatic listing refresh
const loadListings = async () => {
  const response = await api.getListings();
  setListings(response.listings || mockListings);
};

// Refresh after create/delete
const handleBackToListings = () => {
  loadListings(); // Refresh!
  setCurrentView('listings');
};

const handleDeleteListing = () => {
  loadListings(); // Refresh!
  setCurrentView('dashboard');
};
```

### Dashboard.tsx Changes

#### 1. **Proper User Listing Filtering**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Hardcoded to user '1'
const myListings = listings.filter(l => l.sellerId === '1');

// AFTER: Uses actual current user ID
const myListings = listings.filter(l => l.sellerId === currentUser?.id);
```

#### 2. **Delete Demo Listings**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Blocked deletion of demo listings
if (!isRealListing) {
  toast.error('Cannot delete demo listings');
  return;
}

// AFTER: Can delete any listing
await api.deleteListing(listingId);
toast.success('Listing deleted successfully');
```

### Dialog Component Fix

Fixed React ref forwarding:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Function component without forwardRef
function DialogOverlay({ className, ...props }) { ... }

// AFTER: Properly forwarded ref
const DialogOverlay = React.forwardRef<...>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => {
  return <DialogPrimitive.Overlay ref={ref} ... />
});
DialogOverlay.displayName = DialogPrimitive.Overlay.displayName;
```

## 💡 Key Technical Details

### Public Browsing Implementation:
- `currentUser` can be `null` throughout the app
- All components check `if (!currentUser)` before rendering protected features
- Navigation items conditionally render based on login status
- Public actions (browse, search, filter) always work
- Protected actions prompt login

### Listing Persistence:
- Backend is source of truth
- `loadListings()` merges backend + mock data
- Falls back to mock data if backend fails
- Automatic refresh after mutations (create/delete)

### User Filtering:
- Dashboard shows only current user's listings
- Uses `currentUser?.id` for filtering
- Optional chaining prevents errors when not logged in
