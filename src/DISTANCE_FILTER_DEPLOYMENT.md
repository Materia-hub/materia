## üöÄ Deployment Steps

You need to deploy **both frontend and backend** for this feature to work.

### Step 1: Deploy Backend (REQUIRED)

The backend now validates zip codes on all new listings.

**Linux/Mac/WSL:**
```bash
./deploy-backend.sh
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
deploy-backend.bat
```

**Manual (any OS):**
```bash
cd supabase/functions
supabase functions deploy server --no-verify-jwt
cd ../..
```

### Step 2: Verify Backend Deployment

Check the header of your app - you should see:
- ‚úÖ Green badge: "Backend: Up-to-date"

Or run the verification script:
```bash
./check-deployment.sh          # Linux/Mac
check-deployment.bat           # Windows
```

### Step 3: Test the Features

#### Test 1: Try Creating a Listing WITHOUT Zip Code
1. Log in to Materia
2. Click "Create Listing"
3. Fill out the form but **leave Zip Code empty**
4. Click Submit
5. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Error message "Please fill in all required fields including zip code"

#### Test 2: Try Creating a Listing WITH Invalid Zip Code
1. Create a listing
2. Enter zip code: "1234" (4 digits)
3. Click Submit
4. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Error message "Please enter a valid 5-digit zip code"

#### Test 3: Create a Valid Listing
1. Create a listing with a valid zip code (e.g., "90210")
2. Click Submit
3. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Success! Listing created

#### Test 4: Use Distance Filter
1. Go to Browse Listings
2. Click "Filters"
3. Toggle ON "Filter by Distance"
4. Enter your zip code (e.g., "10001")
5. Adjust slider or use the dropdown to select distance
6. ‚úÖ **Expected:** 
   - Distance selector appears in main search bar
   - Blue text shows "Showing listings within X miles"
   - Only listings within that radius are shown

## üéØ How Distance Filtering Works

### For Buyers/Browsers:

1. **Enable Distance Filter:**
   - Click "Filters" button
   - Toggle "Filter by Distance" ON
   - Enter your zip code OR click üìç to use current location

2. **Choose Distance Radius:**
   - Use the dropdown in the blue bar that appears below the search
   - Options: 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 miles, or Nationwide (1000+ miles)
   - Or use the slider in the Filters panel for fine control

3. **Sort by Distance:**
   - Change sort dropdown to "Distance (Nearest)"
   - Closest listings appear first

### For Sellers:

1. **Zip Code is NOW MANDATORY:**
   - When creating a listing, you MUST enter a valid 5-digit zip code
   - The field is marked with an asterisk (*)
   - Help text: "Required for distance-based filtering"

2. **Why Zip Codes Are Required:**
   - Enables buyers to find nearby materials
   - Reduces shipping costs
   - Connects local sellers with local buyers
   - Makes pickup scheduling easier

---

## üîß Backend Validation

The backend now enforces:

1. **Zip code presence:** All listings must have `locationData.zipCode`
2. **Zip code format:** Must be exactly 5 digits (e.g., "12345")
3. **Error responses:**
   - Missing zip: `"Zip code is required for all listings"`
   - Invalid format: `"Zip code must be a valid 5-digit code"`

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify everything works:

- [ ] Backend deployed successfully
- [ ] Backend shows "Up-to-date" status
- [ ] Cannot create listing without zip code
- [ ] Cannot create listing with invalid zip code (e.g., "123")
- [ ] CAN create listing with valid zip code (e.g., "12345")
- [ ] Distance filter toggle appears in Filters panel
- [ ] Can enter zip code for distance filtering
- [ ] Can use "Use my location" button (üìç)
- [ ] Distance dropdown appears in search bar when filter is active
- [ ] Blue indicator text shows "Showing listings within X miles"
- [ ] Listings are filtered by selected distance
- [ ] Can sort by "Distance (Nearest)"
- [ ] Can reset filters to turn off distance filtering

---

## üì± User Experience

### Before Distance Filter:
- Users see ALL listings regardless of location
- No way to find nearby materials
- Location shown but not filterable by distance

### After Distance Filter:
- Users can search within specific radius
- "Within 10 miles" / "Within 25 miles" / etc. options
- Visual indicator shows active filter
- Sort by nearest first
- Easy toggle on/off

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Zip code is required" but I already entered one

**Solution:** Make sure you're entering exactly 5 digits:
- ‚úÖ Valid: "90210", "10001", "33139"
- ‚ùå Invalid: "9021", "902101", "ABCDE"

### Distance filter not working

**Check:**
1. Did you toggle "Filter by Distance" ON?
2. Did you enter a valid zip code?
3. Is your zip code at least 3 digits? (coordinates load after 3+ digits)
4. Try clicking the üìç button to use your current location

### No listings showing when distance filter is active

**Possible reasons:**
1. No listings exist within selected radius
2. Try increasing the distance (e.g., 250 miles or Nationwide)
3. Check that listings have valid zip codes saved

### Backend validation failing

**Fix:**
1. Redeploy backend: `./deploy-backend.sh`
2. Wait 30 seconds for deployment to propagate
3. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. Try creating a listing again

## üìä Data Migration

### Existing Listings:

**If you have existing listings WITHOUT zip codes:**

1. They will still display normally
2. They won't appear in distance-filtered searches
3. You should edit them to add zip codes:
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click edit (‚úèÔ∏è) on each listing
   - Add a valid 5-digit zip code
   - Save changes

**Note:** The backend validation only applies to NEW listings or UPDATES. Existing listings in the database are grandfathered in.

## üîê Security Notes

- Zip codes are stored as plain text (not sensitive data)
- No GPS coordinates are stored
- "Use my location" uses browser geolocation API (requires user permission)
- Coordinates are calculated client-side for distance filtering
- Backend only validates format, not actual existence of zip code

---

## ‚ö° Performance

- Distance calculations happen client-side (fast)
- No additional API calls for distance filtering
- Zip code coordinates are pre-mapped for common US zip codes
- Filter updates are instant (no loading delay)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **For Demo Purposes:** Use zip codes from different areas to test distance filtering
