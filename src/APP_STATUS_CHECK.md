# SupplyWise App Status Check

## Quick Health Check

Run this checklist to verify your app is working:

### ✅ Visual Check (30 seconds)

1. **Open the app in Figma Make**
2. **Do you see:**
   - [ ] The SupplyWise header/logo?
   - [ ] Navigation buttons (Browse Listings, Seller Directory, etc.)?
   - [ ] A "Sign In" button in the top right?
   - [ ] Material listing cards?

**If YES → Your app is rendering! ✅**

### ✅ Console Check (1 minute)

1. **Open Browser DevTools:** Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I`
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for these messages:**

```
🚀 SupplyWise Initializing...
📦 React components loading...
🚀 SupplyWise App Starting...
🔍 Checking for existing session...
✅ Session check complete: No session
✅ Auth loading complete
```

**If you see these → Your app initialized successfully! ✅**

### ✅ Interaction Check (1 minute)

1. **Click "Browse Listings"** → Does it show listings? [ ]
2. **Click "Seller Directory"** → Does it show sellers? [ ]
3. **Click "Sign In"** → Does a signup form appear? [ ]
4. **Click on a listing card** → Does detail view open? [ ]

**If all YES → Your app is fully functional! ✅**

## Understanding What You See in Console

### ✅ GOOD (Your App Working)

These messages mean your app is healthy:

```
🚀 SupplyWise Initializing...
✅ Session check complete
📡 API GET /listings
✅ API Success GET /listings
```

### ⚠️ IGNORE (Figma Internal)

These are from Figma's tools, not your app:

```
Y@https://www.figma.com/webpack-artifacts/...
@https://www.figma.com/webpack-artifacts/...
devtools_worker-cec50cc680e7a980.min.js.br
```

**Rule:** If URL contains `figma.com` → **IGNORE IT**

### ❌ BAD (Real Issues)

These indicate actual problems:

```
❌ REACT ERROR CAUGHT BY ERROR BOUNDARY
❌ Failed to fetch user profile: Network error
❌ API Error POST /signup: Unauthorized
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "I see Figma webpack errors"

**Solution:** These are normal. Ignore them.

**Why:** They're from Figma's internal build tools, not your app.

**Check:** Does the app still work visually and functionally?

---

### Problem: "App shows blank white screen"

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check console for real React errors
2. Look for ErrorBoundary message
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

**Solutions:**
- If ErrorBoundary shows → Read the error message
- If infinite loading → Check Supabase connection
- If no errors but blank → Clear browser cache

---

### Problem: "Can't sign in/sign up"

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check console for `❌ API Error` messages
2. Check Network tab for `/signup` or `/signin` calls
3. Look for 4xx or 5xx errors

**Solutions:**
- 401 Unauthorized → Check Supabase keys
- 500 Server Error → Check backend server logs
- Network error → Server may be offline

---

### Problem: "Features not working"

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check console for specific ❌ errors
2. Check which feature is failing
3. Look for API errors related to that feature

**Solutions:**
- Check if user is logged in (some features require auth)
- Verify API endpoints are responding
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

---

## How to Use Diagnostics Tool

### Option 1: Quick Test
Add temporarily to App.tsx menu items:

```typescript
{ id: 'diagnostics', icon: Activity, label: 'Diagnostics', authRequired: false }
```

Then add to render:
```typescript
{currentPage === 'diagnostics' && <Diagnostics />}
```

### Option 2: Direct Component Test
Temporarily replace main content with:
```typescript
<Diagnostics />
```

### What It Checks:
- ✅ Supabase configuration
- ✅ Supabase connection
- ✅ Backend server health
- ✅ LocalStorage
- ✅ Browser compatibility

---

## Expected Console Output

### On App Load:
```
🚀 SupplyWise Initializing...
📦 React components loading...
🚀 SupplyWise App Starting...
🔍 Checking for existing session...
✅ Session check complete: No session
✅ Auth loading complete
```

### When Browsing Listings:
```
📡 API GET /listings
✅ API Success GET /listings
```

### When Signing Up:
```
📡 API POST /signup
✅ API Success POST /signup
✅ User profile loaded: user@example.com
```

```

### Errors You Might See (And Can Ignore):

[Figma] Webpack errors from devtools_worker
[Figma] HMR errors

```

---

## Performance Check

### Load Time
- **Expected:** 1-3 seconds for initial load
- **Auth check:** < 1 second
- **Listings load:** 1-2 seconds

### If Slower:
