## 🆘 Common Issues

**"User not found" when granting premium**
→ Sign up with dweldy9@gmail.com first, then grant

**Payment failing**
→ Normal in test mode! It's simulating payments.

**Stripe errors**
→ Only if STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set. Check it's correct.

**Backend not responding**
→ Make sure you deployed: `supabase functions deploy make-server-8ae6fee0`
