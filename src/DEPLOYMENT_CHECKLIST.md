- [ ] Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Re-run deployment script
- [ ] Check Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > Logs
- [ ] Verify function name is `make-server-8ae6fee0`

### Problem: Badge Shows "Offline"

2. Supabase project issue
3. Network issue

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Run deployment script
- [ ] Check Supabase Dashboard is accessible

- [ ] Verify project URL in `/utils/supabase/info.tsx`

### Problem: Test Listing Creation Fails

**Check console (F12) for:**

**Common issues:**
- Backend not deployed
- KV store table missing
- Authorization error

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Redeploy backend

2. [ ] Check browser console for errors
3. [ ] Click "Check Backend Directly" in Listing Debugger
4. [ ] Click "Refresh Listings"

## 📊 Understanding the Dashboard Cards

When you open the Dashboard, you'll see **3 diagnostic cards:**

### 1. 🟠 Deployment Instructions (Orange Card)
**Purpose:** Shows you how to deploy  
**When to use:** When badge shows "Needs Update"  
**Can hide:** Yes, click "Hide Instructions"  

### 2. 🔵 Backend Diagnostics (Blue Card)
**Purpose:** Test backend connectivity and functionality  
**Status badge meanings:**
- ✅ Green = Backend up-to-date
- 🟠 Orange = Needs deployment
- 🔴 Red = Offline or error

**Buttons:**
- **Check Backend Health** - Tests version and connectivity
- **Check Listings** - Shows how many listings backend has
- **Create Test Listing** - Creates simple test data

### 3. 🟢 Listing Debugger (Green Card)
**Purpose:** Debug listing display issues  
**Buttons:**
- **Check Backend Directly** - Bypasses UI cache, queries backend
- **Refresh Listings** - Forces reload from backend

---

## 🗑️ Cleanup After Success

Once everything works, you can optionally remove the diagnostic cards:

1. Open `/components/Dashboard.tsx`
2. Remove these lines:
```tsx
<DeploymentInstructions />
<BackendChecker />
<ListingDebugger />
```

**Note:** Keep them for now if you want to monitor backend status!
