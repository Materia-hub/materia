## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### "User not found" when granting premium
**Cause:** User hasn't signed up yet  
**Solution:** Sign up with the email first, then grant premium

### "Not whitelisted" error
**Cause:** Email not in whitelist array  
**Solution:** Email is in the list - check for typos or case

### Payment processing fails
**Cause:** Normal in test mode (simulated)  
**Solution:** This is expected behavior without Stripe

### Stripe payment errors
**Cause:** API key not set or invalid  
**Solution:** Check STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is configured correctly

### Subscription not updating
**Cause:** Backend error or cache issue  
**Solution:** Check backend logs, refresh browser, try again
