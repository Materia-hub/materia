cd supabase/functions

# Check Supabase is linked
supabase link

# Try deploying again
supabase functions deploy make-server-8ae6fee0
```

### Premium Grant Not Working?
- Make sure backend is deployed
- Check you signed up with the whitelisted email
- Refresh the page and try again

### Payment Showing Errors?
- This is normal in test mode - it simulates payments
- Real errors only occur with Stripe API keys configured
- Check browser console for details
