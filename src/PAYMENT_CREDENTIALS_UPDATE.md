- Client-side validation using Luhn algorithm for card numbers
- Secure payment indicator with lock icons
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**Validation:**
- Card number: 16 digits, Luhn algorithm validation
- Expiry date: Valid MM/YY format, must be future date

3. User enters payment credentials
4. System validates and processes payment
5. Success message displays, dialog closes

### 4. API Integration
**File:** `/utils/api.ts`

**New Method:**
```typescript
processPayment: async (paymentRequest: {
  userId: string;
  paymentType: 'pay-per-listing' | 'annual';
  amount: number;
  paymentData: PaymentData;
})
```

**Payment Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  cardNumber: string;        // 16 digits, no spaces
  expiryDate: string;        // MM/YY format
  cvv: string;              // 3-4 digits
  cardholderName: string;   // Full name
  billingAddress: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;          // 2-letter code
    zipCode: string;        // 5 digits
  }
}
```

### 5. Backend Payment Processing
**File:** `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`

**New Endpoints:**

#### POST `/make-server-8ae6fee0/process-payment`
Processes payments for listings and subscriptions.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user-id-here",
  "paymentType": "annual" | "pay-per-listing",
  "amount": 20.00,
  "paymentData": {
    "cardNumber": "1234567890123456",
    "expiryDate": "12/25",
    "cvv": "123",
    "cardholderName": "John Doe",
    "billingAddress": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "IL",
      "zipCode": "62701"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentId": "pay_1234567890_xyz",
  "message": "Payment processed successfully",
  "subscriptionTier": "annual"
}
```

**Features:**
- Stores payment records in KV store with key `payment:{userId}:{paymentId}`
- Only stores last 4 digits of card number for security
- Updates user subscription tier in Supabase Auth metadata
- Sets subscription expiry for annual plans (1 year from purchase)
- Simulates payment processing with 1.5s delay
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### GET `/make-server-8ae6fee0/payments`
Retrieves payment history for authenticated user.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "payments": [
    {
      "id": "pay_1234567890_xyz",
      "userId": "user-id-here",
      "paymentType": "annual",
      "amount": 20,
      "status": "completed",
      "cardLast4": "3456",
      "cardholderName": "John Doe",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-23T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Updated CreateListing Component
**File:** `/components/CreateListing.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated payment handlers to accept `PaymentData` parameter
- Integrated with new `api.processPayment()` method
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Success notifications for both payment types

**Payment Flow:**
1. User reaches listing limit (10 free listings)
2. Subscription dialog appears
3. User selects plan and enters payment info
4. Payment processed via backend
5. User subscription updated
6. User can create listing immediately

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Payment credentials are collected on frontend
- Only last 4 digits of card stored in database
- Full card details are NOT stored anywhere
- Billing address stored for verification purposes
- Basic Luhn algorithm validation on frontend

### Production Recommendations
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** This implementation is for PROTOTYPING purposes only.

For production deployment, you MUST:

1. **Integrate Payment Processor:**
   - Use Stripe, PayPal, Square, or similar
   - Never handle raw card data on your servers
   - Use tokenization for card data
   - Implement PCI DSS compliance

2. **Replace Mock Processing:**
   - Current backend simulates payment processing
   - Replace with actual payment processor API calls
   - Implement webhook handlers for payment status updates

3. **Add Security Features:**
   - 3D Secure (SCA) authentication
   - Fraud detection
   - Rate limiting on payment attempts
   - Card verification (CVV/AVS checks)

4. **Compliance:**
   - PCI DSS certification
   - GDPR compliance for EU users
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular security audits

## Testing

### Test the Payment Flow
1. Create 10 free listings to reach the limit
2. Attempt to create 11th listing
3. Subscription dialog should appear
4. Select "Pay Per Listing" ($0.99)
5. Click "Continue to Payment"
6. Fill out payment form with test data:
   - Card: 4532 1234 5678 9010
   - Expiry: 12/25
   - CVV: 123
   - Name: Test User
   - Address: Any valid US address
7. Click "Pay $0.99"
8. Verify success message
9. Create listing successfully

### Test Annual Subscription
1. Follow steps 1-4 above
2. Select "Annual Plan" ($20/year)
3. Complete payment form
4. Verify unlimited listing status
5. Create multiple listings without additional payments

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Indicators
- üîí Lock icons show secure payment
- Amount due prominently displayed
- Plan type clearly labeled
- Loading states during processing
- Success/error toasts for feedback

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Payment form adapts to mobile screens
- Card inputs optimized for mobile keyboards
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Scrollable dialog on small screens

### Accessibility
- Proper label associations
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Error messages announced
- Focus management in dialog

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Saved Payment Methods**
   - Allow users to save cards (via Stripe)
   - Quick checkout for repeat payments
   - Multiple payment methods

2. **Payment History Page**
   - View all transactions
   - Download receipts
   - Export for accounting

3. **Promotional Codes**
   - Discount codes
   - Referral credits
   - Special offers

4. **Subscription Management**
   - Cancel subscription
   - Change plans
   - Auto-renewal toggles
   - Subscription reminders

5. **Invoice Generation**
   - PDF invoices
   - Email receipts
   - Tax calculations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables needed for current implementation.

For Stripe integration (future):
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment
```bash
# Deploy updated server with payment endpoint
npm run deploy-backend
# or
./deploy-backend.sh
```

### Frontend Deployment
No additional deployment needed - changes are in React components that compile automatically.

### Verification
1. Check backend is running: `GET /make-server-8ae6fee0/health`
2. Verify payment endpoint exists: Should return 400 if called without data
3. Test full payment flow in browser

## Support

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Payment form not appearing
- **Solution:** Check browser console for errors
- Verify SubscriptionDialog props are correct
- Ensure PaymentForm component imported properly

**Issue:** Payment fails with "validation error"
- **Solution:** Check all required fields are filled
- Verify card number passes Luhn check
- Ensure expiry date is in future

**Issue:** Backend returns 500 error
- **Solution:** Check server logs in Supabase dashboard
- Verify KV store is accessible
- Check user metadata update permissions
