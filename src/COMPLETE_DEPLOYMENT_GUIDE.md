## Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend (60 seconds)

Open your terminal and run:

**Linux/Mac/WSL:**
```bash
./deploy-backend.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
deploy-backend.bat
```

**Manual:**
```bash
cd supabase/functions
supabase functions deploy server --no-verify-jwt
cd ../..
```

**Wait for:** "Deployment complete" ✅

---

### Step 2: Verify (30 seconds)

Open Materia in your browser and look at the header.

**Should see:**
- ✅ Green badge: **"Backend: Up-to-date"**

**If you see:**
- 🟠 Orange badge: "Needs deployment" → Redeploy
- 🔴 Red badge: "Offline" → Check logs

---

### Step 3: Test (90 seconds)

#### Test A: Create a Listing
1. Log in
2. Click "Create Listing"
3. Fill everything out **including zip code** (e.g., "90210")
4. Submit
5. ✅ Should succeed and appear in Dashboard

#### Test B: Distance Filter
1. Go to "Browse Listings"
2. Click "Filters"
3. Toggle "Filter by Distance" ON
4. Enter your zip code
5. ✅ Should see distance dropdown appear in search bar

---

## Detailed Steps

### Before You Deploy

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

Get `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` from your Supabase Dashboard URL.

### Deploy Backend

This updates the server with bug fixes and new zip code validation.

**Option 1 - Automated Script (Recommended):**
```bash
./deploy-backend.sh      # Linux/Mac
deploy-backend.bat       # Windows
```

**Option 2 - Manual:**
```bash
cd supabase/functions
supabase functions deploy server --no-verify-jwt
cd ../..
```

**What happens:**
1. Code is bundled
2. Uploaded to Supabase
3. Edge function restarts
4. Takes 10-30 seconds

---

### Verify Deployment

**Method 1 - Visual Check (Easiest):**
1. Open Materia in browser
2. Look at header (top right area)
3. Find small colored badge next to user profile
4. Should say: **"Backend: Up-to-date"** in green

**Method 2 - Automated Check:**
```bash
./check-deployment.sh    # Linux/Mac
check-deployment.bat     # Windows
```

**Method 3 - Manual API Check:**
```bash
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-8ae6fee0/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "2.0.0-kv-fix"
}
```

## Production Deployment

### Turn Off Debug Mode

Before launching to real users:

1. Open `/utils/config.ts`
2. Find line: `export const DEBUG_MODE = true;`
3. Change to: `export const DEBUG_MODE = false;`
4. Save file

**This removes:**
- Yellow warning banner
- Deployment status indicator in header
- Backend diagnostics on Dashboard
- Deployment instructions on Dashboard
- Listing debugger on Dashboard

**App still works perfectly** - debug mode only affects visibility of diagnostic tools.

---

### Final Pre-Launch Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### "Backend: Needs deployment" (Orange Badge)

**Cause:** Code updated but not deployed yet  
**Fix:**
```bash
./deploy-backend.sh
```
Wait 30 seconds, then hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R).

---

### "Backend: Offline" (Red Badge)

**Cause:** Can't reach backend  
**Fix:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Check Supabase Dashboard for outages
3. Verify project is active
4. Check backend logs:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs server
   ```

---

### Listings Not Showing

**Cause:** Either no listings exist or KV store issue  
**Fix:**
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Look at "Listing Debugger" panel
3. Click "Check Backend Directly"
4. Should show count of listings in database
5. If count is 0, create a test listing
6. If count > 0 but not showing, redeploy backend

---

### Distance Filter Not Working

**Possible Issues:**

**Issue A - Can't enable filter:**
- Check that you're on Browse Listings page
- Click "Filters" to open filter panel
- Toggle should be there

**Issue B - No distance dropdown appears:**
- Make sure you've entered at least 3 digits in zip code
- Or clicked the 📍 button to use current location
- Distance dropdown only appears when filter is enabled AND location is set

**Issue C - No listings showing:**
- Try increasing distance (select "Nationwide")
- Check that listings have zip codes
- Verify you have any listings at all

---

### Deployment Fails

**Error: "supabase: command not found"**
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

**Error: "Not logged in"**
```bash
supabase login
```

**Error: "No project linked"**
```bash
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

**Error: "Failed to deploy function"**
1. Check Supabase Dashboard for quota limits
2. Verify you have deploy permissions
3. Check logs for specific error
4. Try redeploying after 1 minute

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Backend Health

**Daily check:**
```bash
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-8ae6fee0/health
```

Should always return:
```json
{"status":"ok","version":"2.0.0-kv-fix"}
```

---

### View Logs

**Real-time logs:**
```bash
supabase functions logs server --tail
```

**Recent logs:**
```bash
supabase functions logs server --limit 100
```

---

### Check Database

**View all listings:**
```bash
# Enable DEBUG_MODE in /utils/config.ts
# Go to Dashboard
# Use "Check Backend Directly" button in Listing Debugger
```

---

## Data Migration

### If You Have Existing Listings Without Zip Codes

**Option 1 - Edit Each Listing:**
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Find each listing
3. Click edit (✏️)
4. Add a 5-digit zip code
5. Save

**Option 2 - Backend Script (Advanced):**
You can manually update the KV store, but this requires direct database access.

**Note:** Existing listings without zip codes will still display, but won't appear in distance-filtered searches.

---

## Performance Notes

- ✅ Distance calculations are **client-side** (instant)
- ✅ No additional API calls for filtering
- ✅ Zip code validation happens **before** network request
- ✅ Results update **immediately** when changing distance
- ⚡ Fast even with 1000+ listings

---

## Security & Privacy

- 🔒 Zip codes stored as plain text (not sensitive)
- 🔒 No GPS coordinates stored in database
- 🔒 Geolocation API requires user permission
- 🔒 Distance calculations done client-side only
- 🔒 Backend validates format, not real existence

---

## Architecture Overview

```
User Creates Listing
    ↓
Frontend Validates Zip Code (5 digits)
    ↓
POST to /listings endpoint
    ↓
Backend Validates Zip Code Again
    ↓
Save to KV Store
    ↓
Return Success

User Filters by Distance
    ↓
Enter Zip Code → Get Coordinates (client-side)
    ↓
Calculate Distance to Each Listing (client-side)
    ↓
Filter Results < Max Distance
    ↓
Display Filtered Listings
```
