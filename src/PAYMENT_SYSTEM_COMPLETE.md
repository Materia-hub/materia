### Payment Flow (Test Mode)
1. User creates 11th listing
2. Payment dialog appears
3. User selects plan (pay-per-listing or annual)
4. Enters credit card info
5. Payment validated and simulated
6. Subscription tier updated
7. Listing created successfully

### Payment Flow (With Stripe)
1. User creates 11th listing
2. Payment dialog appears
3. User selects plan
4. Backend creates Stripe Payment Intent
5. User enters card details
6. Stripe processes payment
7. Backend confirms payment
8. Subscription updated
9. Payment recorded in history
10. Listing created successfully

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Premium Grant Failed
**Issue**: "User not found" error  
**Solution**: Sign up with dweldy9@gmail.com first, then grant premium

**Issue**: "Not whitelisted" error  
**Solution**: Email is in whitelist - check for typos

### Payment Not Processing
**Issue**: Payment fails in test mode  
**Solution**: This is normal - test mode simulates payments

**Issue**: Stripe payment fails  
**Solution**: Check STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set correctly

### Subscription Not Updated
**Issue**: Still shows "Free" tier after payment  
**Solution**: Check backend logs, verify user metadata update
